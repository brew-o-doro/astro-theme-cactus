## What is Git?

As a developer, using version control is one of the most crucial tools to maintaining and collaborating with other developers. Git is one of the most popular version control managers, developed by Linus Torvald in 2005 to be a free open-source software for tracking changes to files and helping developers coordinate tasks when working on huge projects. 

Git is a terminal based tool which means there's a big learning curve for newer developers who have just gotten started programming. Luckily, there are friendlier ways to use Git and maintain your code so that even newbies can use it!

## Enter GitKraken!

GitKraken is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for integrating Git into your projects. This tool makes it very simple for initiating a repository with Git, either locally on your machine or to the cloud with sites such as GitLabs, Github, etc. 

It is as easy as clicking a button and filling out the information for where you want to upload your projects repository. Moreover, you can easily invite others to join your project and easily manage and see the work that they have contributed to your project. 

If you ever encounter any issues in your project, GitKraken makes it very simple to resolve the conflicts by presenting you with the past changes with the current changes!

I highly recommend you use this tool!

It's available at: [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)
